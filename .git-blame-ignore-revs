# See https://www.moxio.com/blog/43/ignoring-bulk-change-commits-with-git-blame
# This file lists commits SHAs that should be ignored in Git blame.
# Right now, there's no "standard" for this, but you can use the file in your own local 'git blame' runs like this:
#
#  git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Many projects are aligning on a standard of having this '.git-blame-ignore-revs' file in the repo to store a default list of "ignored" revs
# GitHub [now supports this as a standard](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view).
