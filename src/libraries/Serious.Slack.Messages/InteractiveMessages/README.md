# Serious.Slack.InteractiveMessages

This library contains types for Slack's [Interactive Messages Framework payloads](https://api.slack.com/legacy/interactive-message-field-guide). 

Note that this is a _deprecated API_ and represents an outmoded approach to composing messages and interactive experiences.

However, Abbot makes use of this in its cross-platform approach to sending replies with buttons. We may migrate that to Block Kit in the future, but for now, we're stuck with this.
