# Composition Objects

Composition objects can be used inside of [block elements](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) and certain [message payload](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/payload) fields. They are simply common JSON object patterns that you'll encounter frequently when [building blocks](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/building) or [composing messages](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing.

Our guide to [Block Kit in app surfaces](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/surfaces) shows you where you can use blocks.
