        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4" id="categories-of-personal-information">Categories of personal information</h4>
        <p>&quot;User Personal Information&quot; is any personal information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
        <p>&quot;Technical Information&quot; may include information we collect from website browsers, such as web server logs, or other log information, such as User session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User Personal Information such as a username or an email address, or to other potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>
        <p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p>
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4" id="information-from-users-with-accounts">Information from users with accounts</h4>
        <p>If you <strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include &quot;User Personal Information.&quot;</p>
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4" id="information-from-website-browsers">Information from website browsers</h4>
        <p>If you&#39;re <strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs, to collect Technical Information. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>
        <p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request.

        <li>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on A Serious Business, Inc..</li>

        <li>We collect Technical Information to better understand how our website visitors use A Serious Business, Inc., and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</li>
        <li>We collect personal information from third parties for the purposes for which it was authorized to be collected. For example, you may authorize A Serious Business, Inc. to contact you for marketing purposes via a third party&#39;s platform. If we need to use your personal information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.</li>
        <li>We use your User Personal Information and Technical Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation and compliance.</li>
        <li>We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement.

        </ul>
        <h5 id="our-legal-basis-for-processing-information">Our legal basis for processing information</h5>
        <p>Under certain international laws (including GDPR), A Serious Business, Inc. is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. A Serious Business, Inc. processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Contract Performance:<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>When you create an account on Abbot, you provide your user name and an email address or a user authorization token from a chat service like Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases.</li>
        <li>If you purchase a paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. A Serious Business, Inc. does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.  </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Consent:<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>As a user, your user profile information is filled out every time you authenticate to the service using the information provided by your authentication provider (such as Google G-Suite). You can fill out addition information in your user profile such as your phone number. If you decide to participate in a A Serious Business, Inc. research project or survey, you may choose to provide User Personal Information or other personal information to us for limited purposes. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Legitimate Interests:<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of A Serious Business, Inc.&#39;s systems, website, and service, we must keep logs of Technical Information; and, in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@aseriousbusiness.com">privacy@aseriousbusiness.com</a>.</li>

        <p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although A Serious Business, Inc. does not request or intentionally collect any other sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository or in your public profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>
        <p>If you&#39;re a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not have an account on Abbot. A Serious Business, Inc. does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will have to close your account. Please see our <a href="../terms">Terms of Service</a> for information about account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Abbot without obtaining your parents&#39; or legal guardians&#39; consent.</p>
        <p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is <strong>stored in your boards</strong> or other free-form content inputs.

        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> host advertising on Abbot. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads.

        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> disclose User Personal Information outside Abbot, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on <a href="#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure">Compelled Disclosure</a>.</p>
        <p>We <strong>do</strong> share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Abbot. For example, we may compile general usage statistics of Abbot. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>
        <p>We <strong>do</strong> share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services.

        <p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.</p>

        <p>As an A Serious Business, Inc. User, you can always take your data with you. You can visit your personal data settings and download all the data we have about you.

        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4" id="data-retention-and-deletion-of-data">Data retention and deletion of data</h4>
        <p>Generally, A Serious Business, Inc. will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>
        <p>We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.</p>
        <p>If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days.

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4" id="our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking">Our use of cookies and tracking</h3>
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4" id="cookies">Cookies</h4>
        <p>Abbot&#39;s websites (<a href="https://ab.bot">https://ab.bot</a> and <a href="https://app.ab.bot">https://app.ab.bot</a>) use cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of A Serious Business, Inc.. For security reasons, we use cookies to identify a device. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use A Serious Business, Inc.’s services. On certain areas of the website, we may also use cookies to identify you and/or your device to advertise A Serious Business, Inc. products and services to you on third party sites.</p>
        <p>We provide a web page on <a href="cookies">cookies and tracking</a> that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the types of cookies they are (temporary or permanent). It also lists our third party analytics providers and details exactly which parts of our website we permit them to track.</p>
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4" id="tracking-and-analytics">Tracking and analytics</h4>
        <p>We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users&#39; use of Abbot; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. We only use these third party analytics providers on certain areas of our website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of personal information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.</p>
        <p>Some browsers have incorporated &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Abbot responds to browser DNT signals and follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/">W3C standard for responding to DNT signals</a>. If you have not enabled DNT on a browser that supports it, cookies on some parts of our website will track your online browsing activity on other online services over time, though we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track Abbot users&#39; activity over time on Abbot.</p>
